# TizonaServer

## ü§î What is TizonaServer?

TizonaServer is the backend engine behind [TizonaHub](https://github.com/TizonaHub), but it can also be used independently as a standalone server or API.  
It handles file storage, user management, and all server-side operations, acting as the core of your private cloud.  
Installed on a local machine or server, **TizonaServer ensures that all your data stays under your full control**, without relying on external services.

TizonaServer follows the same installation and setup process as TizonaHub.  
For a step-by-step guide, please refer to the [Getting Started](../../tizonahub/getting-started) section of the TizonaHub documentation.
